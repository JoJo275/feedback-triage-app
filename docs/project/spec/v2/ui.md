# v2.0 — UI

> Topical detail file. Entry point: [`../spec-v2.md`](../spec-v2.md).
> Brand and visual direction: [`core-idea.md`](core-idea.md).

React + TypeScript (Vite) now powers migrated workspace/public routes,
mounted through FastAPI shell templates per
[ADR 077](../../../adr/077-use-react-vite-as-v2-page-runtime.md).

Server-rendered pages still exist for auth and selected legacy paths.
Tailwind utility classes and tokens remain part of the style layer
([ADR 058](../../../adr/058-tailwind-via-standalone-cli.md)).

## Page routes (HTMLResponse)

| Route                                | Auth         | Notes |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------ | ----- |
| `/`                                  | none / redirect | Marketing landing + mini demo. Logged-in users → `/w/<slug>/dashboard` |
| `/login`, `/signup`                  | none         | |
| `/forgot-password`, `/reset-password`, `/verify-email` | none | |

## JS conventions

- React entrypoint is `web/src/main.tsx`, compiled by Vite into
  `src/feedback_triage/static/app/` with a hashed manifest.
- FastAPI templates pass route identity through data attributes
  (`data-page-key`, `data-active-section`) and bootstrap JSON payloads
  where needed.
- Shared client concerns (API calls, telemetry, error normalization)
  live in `web/src/lib/` and `web/src/hooks/`.
- Legacy page scripts under `src/feedback_triage/static/js/` remain only
  for intentionally server-rendered routes.

### Client-side rendering safety (XSS)

User-controlled content (feedback `title` / `description` / `release_note`,
submitter `name`, note `body`, tag `name`) is rendered **client-side**
from JSON. The escape contract:

- React-rendered text content must stay in JSX text nodes (automatic
  escaping). Avoid `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` for user data.
- For non-React legacy scripts, keep using
  `element.textContent = value` and never template user input into HTML.
- For multi-line text (descriptions, notes), set `textContent` and
  use CSS `white-space: pre-wrap` to preserve newlines. **Do not**
  replace `\n` with `<br>` in JS.
- For attribute values built from JSON (e.g. `href` for an email
  link), use `setAttribute("href", "mailto:" + value)` and never
  string-template into the HTML source.
- The single legitimate `innerHTML` site is the inline SVG chart
  builders, which only template *server-controlled* numbers. They
  must never receive a value that originated in JSON.
- No third-party sanitizer (DOMPurify, etc.) is added — forbidding
  `innerHTML` on user data is sufficient and zero-dependency.

This rule is enforced by review; a Playwright e2e test
(`tests/e2e/test_xss_smoke.py`) submits feedback containing
`<script>alert(1)</script>` and asserts the literal text is rendered
on Inbox and detail pages with no script execution
([`risks.md`](risks.md) E11).

## Sidebar order

The authenticated workspace sidebar lists exactly these eight
items, in this order:

| # | Item       | Default route                  |
| - | ---------- | ------------------------------ |
| 1 | Dashboard  | `/w/<slug>/dashboard`          |
| 2 | Inbox      | `/w/<slug>/inbox`              |
| 3 | Feedback   | `/w/<slug>/feedback`           |
| 4 | Submitters | `/w/<slug>/submitters`         |
| 5 | Roadmap    | `/w/<slug>/roadmap`            |
| 6 | Changelog  | `/w/<slug>/changelog`          |
| 7 | Insights   | `/w/<slug>/insights`           |
| 8 | Settings   | `/w/<slug>/settings`           |

Under `md` (≤ 768 px), the sidebar collapses into a top-of-page
`<details>` disclosure ([`css.md`](css.md) §"Responsive strategy").
The shell partial is the single source of truth; reordering touches
one template.

## Charts

Inline SVG, hand-rolled. No Chart.js, no D3, no Recharts. v2.0's
chart needs (intake sparkline, top-tags bar, status donut) are all
~30-line SVG components. A charting library is its own ADR if the
need ever justifies it.

---

## Iconography

[Lucide](https://lucide.dev/) icons exported as static SVGs into
`src/feedback_triage/static/img/icons/`. No `lucide-react`, no JS
icon library — pure inline SVG.

---

## Public submission form

Per workspace, at `/w/<slug>/submit`. Fields:

| Field         | Type        | Required | Notes |
| ------------- | ----------- | -------- | ----- |
| Description   | textarea    | yes      | 1–4000 chars |
| Type          | select      | yes      | `type_enum` values; `other` reveals `type_other` |
| Source        | hidden      | —        | always `web_form` |
| Pain level    | radio 1–5   | no       | optional |
| Email         | email       | no       | if provided, links/creates a `submitters` row |
| Name          | text        | no       | only used if email provided |
| Honeypot      | hidden text | —        | empty; non-empty submissions are silently dropped (see [`security.md`](security.md)) |

**Validation:**

- `Type = other` reveals an inline `type_other` text field
  (1–60 chars, required when shown). Submitting `type=other` with
  an empty `type_other` returns `422` with
  `code=type_other_required` and the message
  *"Please describe the type when choosing 'Other.'"*
- `source` is server-set to `web_form`; clients cannot set it.
- The same dual-field rule applies to authenticated `POST
  /api/v1/feedback`: `(source = 'other') == (source_other IS NOT NULL)`
  enforced by both Pydantic and DB CHECK ([`schema.md`](schema.md),
  [`security.md`](security.md)).

Submission UX: success page thanks the user, optionally offers to
follow this feedback by email if they provided one, links back to
the workspace's public roadmap (if any).

## Mini demo (FU1)

A small, self-contained interactive widget on the landing page:

- 8–12 hardcoded JSON feedback items.
- Vanilla JS state (no framework), no backend, no network calls.
- The visitor can drag a status pill, mark a row as planned, type
  in the search box. Refresh resets to the seed.
- Acts as a *"playable screenshot"* that the marketing copy can
  reference: "Try it — no signup required."

---

## Accessibility floor

WCAG 2.2 AA targeted; specific rules:

- Every status / priority pill carries **icon + text + color**, never
  color alone.
- All controls have `:focus-visible` styles using the `--color-focus`
  token.
- Modals use `<dialog>` with `.showModal()`; focus trap is the
  browser's.
- One `<h1>` per page, sequential headings.
- Skip link to `#main` on every page.
- Forms: every `<input>` has a paired `<label for>`; errors are
  announced via `aria-live="polite"`.
- Reduced-motion: `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` zeroes
  out animations and transitions.

A Playwright smoke test loads each top-level page and runs
[`axe-core`](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core) — failures fail
CI. (Tooling addition tracked in [`tooling.md`](tooling.md).)
